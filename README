This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, make(>=V3.81), 
gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

Simply running 'make' will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type make -C docs/ to build it.

Building your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system.
Cygwin will not be supported because of the lack of case sensitiveness.

Sunshine!
